Steven Leffler,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,15-Apr-21,99,"This app is fatally flawed. They designed it so that the only way to trigger an alert after you test positive is for a public health worker to call you after your positive test and give you a code. They didn't put the resources in place to make sure they could call everyone promptly, which makes the app pretty much useless.",
mindlessbuddha,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,7-Jun-21,8,"This app is worthless. They dont use actual hospital or govt med records to create the database. My neighbor had covid, went to the hospital, it never alerted. So what's the point? Less than 1M people used it. Philly 7M people, PA over 20M. It's worthless. I can get the same alerts from Philly's OEM text service. Even Citizen app. This has no reliable functionality other than giving current Covid numbers. It can't warn you effectively.",
Stephanie,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,24-May-21,8,"Why is there no obvious way to designate if I've received a COVID positive test to propntly warn the people I've possibly exposed to the disease?! If this is a feature, it's hidden deep in the app. I would have put that at the top of the home page. What exactly is the utility of this app? :(",
Juan Borla,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,15-Mar-21,121,"Straight doesn't work. Not sure why, might be because my phone is rooted, but when I click Continue on the ""Your data"" page, it simply says ""Sorry, that didn't work properly, error 104"" and I can go no further.",
R Schultz,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,27-Apr-21,6,"How helpful can it be, today is 4/27/21, the info was last updated 4/18/21. Good thing I'm not depending on it letting me or others know about exposures. Or maybe PA has stopped using it?",
Roseanne Cohen,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,29-May-21,6,"The numbers for total cases, hospitalizations and deaths given in this app are incorrect. This should be investigated and rectified. The Commonwealth itself is spreading misinformation. Shame on them. Remain vigilent and know your source information. Don't waste your time with this app. It's useless.",

KorTazG,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,28-Mar-21,25,"I have no experience on this app, but this app is horrible the truth is that the government wants more money so they come up with this virus in 2020 but it's been out since like 2016 or less. It's so dumb that we live in this world of lies.",

Greg Kingston,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,12-May-21,3,"Privacy concerns - after all the promises of privacy and safeguards, 70,000 people had their private information from the company doing contact tracing leaked online. Pass on the government Spyware.",
Jacqueline Clous,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,28-Mar-21,1,This app still provides no useful real-time data. Exposure alerts are delayed and don't go off to let you know they happen. by the time you find out you've been exposed you might as well already be getting a test. Good try PA but failure so far.,
Joe Peregrin,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,20-Jan-21,129,"Save your time & storage space, it doesn't work. I received a call today as a follow-up to my quarantine. ""What quarantine?"" I ask. It appears that I was exposed to COVID-19 on Jan 7. I should have been notified to quarantine. Only, the entire system failed. 1. Employer never notified me of an exposure. 2. PA Department of Health never notified me of an exposure until 3 days AFTER quarantine ended. 3. App with exposure alert on did nothing! Waste of time. #NoConfidence #SystemIsBroken",
Demonfang Arun,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,18-Jan-21,9,"Never got any alerts, and when I had covid for a couple weeks they never gave me a code even after calling in to request it (they were supposed to reach out, never happened). Don't trust this app to alert you, chances are most people never got a code.",
Sabastian Zeiss,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,21-Feb-21,115,The app itself is decent however it will only work when the County department of health is willing to work with it. I recently got diagnosed with covid and has been almost a week for a call with the validation code for the app.,
Ki O'Rourke,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,13-Feb-21,9,"Besides the fact that the app is not that great, in no way do I trust The People's Republic of Pennsylvania. I guess their drones in the sky constantly watching us weren't enough. Now they want to use our phones to track us better. I'd like to believe this is to help with COVID but my gut tells me otherwise.",

Scott Corbin,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,2-Nov-20,332,"Despite the description saying that this app uses Bluetooth to determine if you have been near someone with Covid/Covid symptoms, it is telling me I must have location services (GPS) turned on to work (to get Exposure Notifications). Between privacy and battery life concerns, this is a no-go for me. Publisher - please explain why location services (GPS) is required.

Ted Harrington,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,10-Oct-20,193,"The app says that exposure alerts are disabled and that I need to check my devices settings. When going to check the device's settings it tells me that the correct settings are enabled.

Matthew Smith,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,15-Oct-20,85,"Requires location permission for no reason I can discern since this supposedly relies purely upon bluetooth. Maybe this app doesn't use it, but as a convenient (for Google & other advertisers) side effect it gives EVERY OTHER APP with said permission access to my location at ALL times (never mind the additional battery drain they'll cause). Other apps can use BT without location being on. Google's being slimy in order to get full-time location tracking through other apps. KMA, Google.","Commonwealth of PennsylvaniaOctober 29, 2020Hello, COVID Alert PA has no access to any location data.

M & M Investigations,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,4-Dec-20,116,"The only advantage to this app is immediate information. However, I am not convinced that is accurate.

George Overly,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,22-Nov-20,16,"This app is useless. Why would anyone care how many people look at this app or THINK they have symptoms. It shows a percentage of statewide cases per county that doesn't mean anything and gives us symptoms that every person able to use the app knows.

What this DOES use is near-range Bluetooth beacon scanning, so if someone else has the app and you pass them, their UNIDENTIFIABLE ""id"" gets tagged by you, and if their medical professional/PCP/etc positively tests them for COVID-19, it will alert those whose tokens were saved. It's effectively the 3DS's Street Pass lol. AGAIN IT DOES NOT USE OR REQUIRE CONTACTS OR PRIVATE INFORMATION. Help be safe, help others be safe.",
John Laskos,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,7-Nov-20,221,"Very clever idea. Part of me wants it to alert me so I know it works but then I don't want to know I was that close to a positive person. There is very minimal battery draw even with location on. Since I have hands free phone in my car, the bluetooth is always on anyway. I have a samsung A10e. Nice job!!","Commonwealth of PennsylvaniaNovember 23, 2020We appreciate your feedback. Thank you for adding your phone to the COVID-19 fight!"
Stosh Przychowicz,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,30-Sep-20,295,"Ok folks, does the app ask for gps permission? Nope. Does the app ask for access to your contacts? Nope. Does the app ask for access to your storage? Nope. The claims by so called IT professionals who don't have the least understanding on how the Android OS allows aps to work on your device and are claiming it invades your privacy are bogus. Battery drain, that could be an issue, sure. Chances are if that is your case, you need to backup your device and do a factory reset then restore.",
Frank Rugienius,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,26-Sep-20,110,"Easy to set up and register. Interface is easy to use. More details about ""how it works"" would be useful. Examples of info I was looking for but couldn't find: Will notifications about an individual be sent every time our locations coincide or just once for that person? How long will notifications be sent from an individual who tests positive once they put in their 6 digit code? The word used in the FAQ is ""recent"". How long is that?","Commonwealth of PennsylvaniaSeptember 29, 2020Thanks for the feedback. We made note of your comment. We’re always keeping an eye out for new ways to improve, and we will send your suggestion to our development team."
Ted Voltolina,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,22-Sep-20,196,"Please install this app and spread the word! The more people use it, the more effective it is, and the faster we can all return to some semblance of normalcy. And just to be clear regarding privacy -- not only does this app NOT use your location, it actually doesn't request ANY permissions from your device. It only uses Bluetooth to determine if you have been in close contact with someone who tested positive and also has the app installed.","Commonwealth of PennsylvaniaSeptember 23, 2020We appreciate your positive feedback. Thank you for using the COVID Alert PA app and adding your phone to the COVID-19 fight!"
Russell Spaulding,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,29-Oct-20,23,I figured out that every time I had attempted to install the app I was at work and the wifi was blocking the startup page. Turned off wifi and found a cell signal and it works just fine. I have a pixel 2xl with android 11. The app would not get past the start screen that asks if I'm ok sharing usage data.,"Commonwealth of PennsylvaniaOctober 29, 2020Thank you for letting us know. We are sorry to hear that you are having trouble with the app. Please email us at ra-dh-CovidApp@pa.gov and provide more information about your device so we can assist you."
Alexa LaMontagne,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,20-Oct-20,4,"I've been using this app for two weeks and have had zero issues. It sends me a reminder every morning to check in and I feel better knowing that if I am potentially exposed to Covid, I will be notified quickly and securely.",
billy hamilton,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,29-Mar-21,0,It's very easy to understand and to follow Thank You very much.,
Frank Messina,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,7-Oct-20,22,Great app to help fight the spread. All PA residents should download this to help. I can confirm what others have said that the app requires no permissions and only uses low-energy bluetooth. It didn't have to be this way.,"Commonwealth of PennsylvaniaOctober 8, 2020Thank you for taking the time to give a positive review!

Donald Noble,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,21-Oct-20,10,"Easy to install, did not ask for my location, and appears to run in the background even with the app closed/swiped (integration with Android?) - Looks good! Will update or submit feedback otherwise should I find any issues. Thanks!",
Matt Love,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,18-Dec-20,105,Everyone should use this app. It's easy to use to check in your health symptoms. I have experienced no battery drain on my phone. The battery use is less then 1 minute today and only 0.1% of my total battery use since last charge. So far no exposure notifications and I hope it stays that way.,"Commonwealth of PennsylvaniaJanuary 5, 2021We appreciate your feedback. Thank you for adding your phone to the COVID-19 fight!"
Roger Filmyer,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,10-Feb-21,1,(Hopefully) keeping us safe. Contains COVID stats so useful even when you're not putting yourself at risk. Refreshingly well-designed for a gov't app. I never got an alert so I don't know how well the COVID tracing works.,
Joseph Larch,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,14-Oct-20,15,Don't know if it really works since i haven't received any alerts yet. But it is a good app to have just incase. But other people around you have to have the app installed also for it to work. So if nobody around you don't have the app on their phone and has the virus you never even know you were exposed to Covid 19. Then if you dont feel well you don't know if it's a cold or the virus. But as i said it is a good idea to have it installed because you never really know who has it.,
Tracey Mazzatenta Independent Scentsy Consultant,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,8-Feb-21,10,"Great & Easy to use although I have only ever selected ""I'm good no issues"". Participate in surveys about how to improve app also.",
Andre Grachev,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,27-Sep-20,27,"Looks like a solid app. Even though I wish it had been rolled out sooner, congrats on a job well done. One minor note: in the latest info section it would be great if the graphs for cases/mortality were aligned along the X (time) axis to show correlation more accurately. Presently, the starting points are about 2 weeks off.","Commonwealth of PennsylvaniaSeptember 29, 2020Thank you for the idea! We value your feedback and want to improve the app with each update. We have sent your suggestion to our development team."
Monique bbchanel,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,15-Oct-20,23,This app is very informative. I love that there is something that gives updated information about where I live and that I am able to know about possible exposure. I have been using this app since September and have recommended the app to my family. Personally I think everyone should have this app.,
Kathy Z,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,12-Dec-20,17,"Easy to use. I like the county breakdowns. It should have a back button on the symptom checklist, though. The one day I missed checking a symptom on the first list page and couldn't go back from the second page to check it. I wish everyone was using this.","Commonwealth of PennsylvaniaJanuary 5, 2021Thank you for taking the time to give a positive review. Be sure to spread the word about the COVID Alert PA app amongst your family and friends!"
Jim Guckin,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,25-Sep-20,45,"As an IT Security professional, this app is the real deal, doesn't require excess permissions, minimal impact to phone functionality and put out by a trusted authority. As a person, who wouldn't want this, to know if you've come into contact with in infected person or let people you've come in contact that you've been exposed all anonymously. Everyone should have this on their phones.","Commonwealth of PennsylvaniaSeptember 29, 2020We appreciate your feedback. Thank you for adding your phone to the COVID-19 fight!"
Dan MacGregor,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,25-Sep-20,20,"Really great app and uses Google's and Apple's contact tracing that is built-in to your phones OS. Which means it doesn't use any additional battery, it's private and requires no information about you. All it needs to work is Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)!","Commonwealth of PennsylvaniaSeptember 29, 2020Thank you for taking the time to give a positive review. Be sure to spread the word about the COVID Alert PA app to your family and friends!"
Nathan Schmid,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,11-Oct-20,9,Happy PA pushed out this app. The only negative is we didn't have it sooner like some other states did. The prominent home screen placement in Google Play Store is nice.. but need to see this advertised thru all social channels at a minimum. Consider adding to share feature some images or even a snapchat lense for better reach.,"Commonwealth of PennsylvaniaOctober 14, 2020Thanks for the feedback! We made note of your comment. We’re always keeping an eye out for new ways to improve the app."
Nathan Cunningham,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,13-Oct-20,17,Ive been watching for this app for a while just glad its here. UI is good and seems simple to navigate. Ive seen reviews complaining about battery life but I leave my GPS and Bluetooth on all day and this app only uses a tenth of a percent of battery life. So far so good,"Commonwealth of PennsylvaniaOctober 14, 2020We appreciate your feedback. Thank you for adding your phone to the COVID-19 fight!"
Noble Ward,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,14-Nov-20,19,Nothing but problems with this foolish app. It drains the battery encroaches on civil liberties. I would prefer instead of asking if I were male female or prefer not to say.... I have been diagnosed with body dysmorphia I insist too be placated too by the general public. I should probably be aware that treating something whenever I'm genetically male or female not a gender that I choose because of my psychological problems May hamper the effectiveness.,
John McKenna,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,25-Sep-20,12,"Keep up the good work fighting COVID. This app does NOT use ANY permissions (contacts, GPS, etc), despite the idiot ""IT Pros"" that haven't even used the app or have any idea how it works. Shouldn't the app turn off battery optimizations though, so Android doesn't kill it?",
Debbie Q,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,29-Sep-20,5,"I just received the app awhile ago, and I am so glad PA put it out. It has a lot of very good information and is easy to use.

Brett Domenick,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,6-Nov-20,2,Working as intended. Wish more people were using it though. Kind of defeats the purpose if only a small portion of the population is tracking.,
Leah,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,17-Nov-20,4,"Please download this app to keep every Pennsylvanian safe. It asks once a day if you are having symptoms, and if you test positive you can let the app know. This way anyone whose phone recently came in proximity to yours will get notified. It uses bluetooth, NOT location, and the random ID numbers are anonymous and get purged regularly. It only works well if everyone is on board.
