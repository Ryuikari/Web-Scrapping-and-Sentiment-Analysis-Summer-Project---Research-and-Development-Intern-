Blue,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,31-Mar-21,26,I've had this app on my phone for months and it hasn't alerted once! How is that possible when I go to Wal-Mart and run errands at least once a week. I also noticed that no matter how many hours I'm out and about the ONLY time it does its random checks is when I'm home! One day in particular I was in and out of my house a couple of times and I compared the documented checks with my Google maps log and all 4 checks were while I was obviously home! This app is totally useless if NO ONE USES IT!!,"CT Department of Public HealthApril 5, 2021The app will only alert you if you are within 15 feet for 15 min, walking around a store will more than likely not trip the notification. The checks you are seeing are simply the uplink to the server that records the phones you were near. That way it can notify those devices."
Nick-E Nicole,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,28-Dec-20,53,"Why ONLY allow the fingerprint scan option and not offer the password/pin option? (Meanning I cannot access the scanned list). Is it that challenging for the devs to realize we all don't utilize/have access to the SAME FEATURES. This app is the equivalent of a paperweight, in my phone.","CT Department of Public HealthJanuary 22, 2021Thanks for your feedback! We deeply respect your advice, and we will try to combine your feedback with our R&D, in order to provide better products."
Cara-Lynn Turner,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,4-Jan-21,59,"I work in a residential facility where both staff and residents have cell phones. Not once, with any positive case, has this app notified me of an exposure. Very disappointing.","CT Department of Public HealthJanuary 22, 2021This is why we need more people using the app, we have a third of our residents using the app. The more we can get to download and install the safer our communities will be."
B,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,7-Jan-21,4,"This App does nothing, I have been in contact with several people who had tested positive for COVID and this app did not alert me to anything.","CT Department of Public HealthJanuary 26, 2021Hello, maybe the contact you were around did not have the app installed or configured. Your problem needs more detailed examination. Please report it to our technical support team at DPH.CovidAlertCT@ct.gov. We are always looking to help our users."
solid snake,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,20-Feb-21,4,Pointless app. I've had one exposure alert.,"CT Department of Public HealthApril 5, 2021We apologize for the inconvenience. Can you be more specific please so that we can identify the issue? Don't hesitate to reach out to us at DPH.CovidAlertCT@ct.gov."

Michael Reid,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,6-Jan-21,5,Deficiencies with this app. A. Not everyone in Ct. has this installed on their cell phone. B. Not everyone that tests positive is reporting it. There's been 2 ppl at work that recently tested positive and this app never alerted me.,"CT Department of Public HealthJanuary 26, 2021This is exactly why we need more residents to install the app."
Mike Lerch,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,1-May-21,45,"Overreaching, evil tracking, just so govt can get you used to ""social tracking"" & who you intact with Edit 5/2021: thank you for the reply. Establishing a list of recipients to alert requires the app to connect to and extange information from nearby bluetooth devices, running continuously/silently in the background. Monitoring the individuals we interact with in 6ft. It is not anonymous if the app can identify the user to alert them, there is an unique traceable indentifier somewhere","CT Department of Public HealthJanuary 26, 2021No, not at all. This app simply uses bluetooth to alert you and those around you if have been exposed to COVID. This app is not a tracker, or social recorder. It simply alerts you if you have been exposed. If you become positive it would alert people who have been within 6ft of your phone. completely anonymously "
Zak Gurski,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,11-Jan-21,3,"Not useful at all. Based on responses by the Dev, this app uses Bluetooth to communicate with other phones that have the app and are atleast 6ft from you for 15 min...that means if someone is in my 6ft circumference and has COVID but walks away before the 15 min, the app won't notify me?","CT Department of Public HealthJanuary 26, 2021This based on CDC guide lines. No Zak it wont as you were not with in the parameters that would cause a need to get tested."
Fred Janson,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,2-Jan-21,2,Totally pointless. Unless everyone else is using theres no point in having it. My wife and I have been around several people who have been covid positive and never received a warning.,"CT Department of Public HealthJanuary 22, 2021This is why we need more people using the app, we have a third of our residents using the app. The more we can get to download and install the safer our communities will be."
OG_Skullkid 13,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,12-May-21,4,This app is garbage. Its for conspiracy nuts who just cant get over the bs. Theres no need to continue perpetuating this kind of fear. This is a garbage app that does literally nothing except monitor and track what youve been doing and where youve been going. Nothing more nothing less. What should scare you all is that this kind of software exists and is being used to track your habbits for marketing purposes and keep you in fear. Get over yourselves. Its over.,
Matt Z,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,30-Nov-20,23,"Contact tracing is a joke..... My kids have had covid for over a week and a half now, no one has called... I've had it for a week now and no one has called. And u can't report it to the app without be contacted, so someone infected is going around infecting other and not knowing it. Great job CT!","CT Department of Public HealthNovember 30, 2020Matt - we are very sorry you are ill.

matthew carrasquillo,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,6-May-21,1,This app is trash waste of space and battery consumption I have came in to contact with lots of people with covid this app has not gone off once to let me know,
6th Face Comics,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,4-Mar-21,1,"The state has abandoned this cancer patient, so you can pound sand.

S Oram,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,14-Jan-21,4,"Poor, at best. I know I have been in close proximity to many individuals who have tested positive. Never once have i been notified. There is 1 person I know for certain and I spend an extensive amount of time with. I should have received a notice. I got bubkiss.","CT Department of Public HealthJanuary 26, 2021This could be do to the fact the person you know did not have the app installed, have their Bluetooth enabled while also getting an activation code. This works when all three are enabled on the Covid positive patient's phone. This is why its so important for residents to install the app and activate the utility when asked. "

Darthshawn,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,19-Dec-20,7,I have never received a warning no I'm not sure if the app works or not. I have been diagnosed with Covid-19. I went to put it on the app. And it asks for a code. What code. I got a test result not a code for a gift card. And no explanation on the app as to where I find or get a code. Maybe this is why I haven't received any warnings. Should have known something from the CT government would not work well,"CT Department of Public HealthDecember 17, 2020We are sorry you have been tested positive. The code required to alert your contacts (people you have a been within 6 feet for 15 Min) is generated by the CT Contact Tracing team.

Liz E,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,1-Jan-21,0,Just saw,"CT Department of Public HealthJanuary 22, 2021Dear User, thanks for your support. If you like us, please encourage us with 5★ : ) "
Jason Nesheim,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,20-Apr-21,30,"I don't normally rate apps. Just looking through all the reviews and it's a shame that people ignorant to how the app actually works are leaving negative reviews. Download the app. Let it run. If you test positive, record it in the app. If someone else running this app tests positive and records it in the app, you will receive an alert (If you were near that person for more than 15min). Other than that, the app will silently run until something happens. It's not that hard to understand...",
Ja Kr,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,22-Mar-21,15,"Great idea in need of more widespread usage. I have no issue having my anonymous data help people I am in proximity with. I have not gotten any alerts, but I tend to not be out and about a lot during the pandemic so I'm probably less susceptible than many.",
Jake Crystal,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,24-Jan-21,35,Simple app. 5 stars because it works but more people need to download. Stop uninstalling because there is not enough people. Install and let it work. Only need to do something if you test positive.,"CT Department of Public HealthJanuary 26, 2021Thank you for this review! "
Christian,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,13-Feb-21,16,Simple enough to use. The best way to get the most out of this app is to encourage your friends & family to also get the app! It's a community effort.,
David Struff,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,13-Feb-21,14,I like this. It's simple and easy. I wish my state participated in the program (a state next to mine does).,
Bill Ostrove,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,13-Nov-20,113,"Happy with this app so far. It was easy to set up. I like that it focuses on privacy (no permissions required, data anonimized, etc) while helping me do my part to keep us all safe.","CT Department of Public HealthNovember 25, 2020Bill - Thank you. This App is totally anonymous and collects no personal data. **SMcC DPH App Admin **"
Tonya Bond,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,14-Nov-20,58,So far so good. I like that you are not required to put your personal information in to use the app. Im happy they came up with something to notify you if someone nearby has the coronavirus.,"CT Department of Public HealthNovember 25, 2020Tonya - Once installed, this is completely Anonymous. I truly hope you never have to use that feature ! **SMcC DPH App Admin **"
Jordan Lewis,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,13-Nov-20,146,"The app requires ZERO permissions on your phone. the app doesn't know who you are, and doesn't know where you are. They did a great job at anonymizing your data. again, GPS IS NOT REQUIRED OR ASKED FOR. it's either we install this app or shutdown the country.","CT Department of Public HealthNovember 25, 2020Jordan - Thank you. You are absolutely correct! This App is totally anonymous and collects no personal data, including location. **SMcC DPH App Admin **"
Melissa Pelletier,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,15-Nov-20,29,"Installed without any issues. I was worried that it might drain the battery but so far, it uses so little it registers as 0% per hour.",
Sam Cyanide,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,28-Nov-20,6,"Nice app, like others have said i appreciate that it doesnt require permissions and the privacy model is transparent. Only thing that could make it better is if it was open source.","CT Department of Public HealthNovember 30, 2020Sam - Thank you for your support! Unfortunately we can not make it open source. . . But we have made it FREE! Both the Google and Microsoft ENx Teams are actively involved in regular integration changes and updating of this. ** SMcC DPH Admin **"
ramana vtv,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,28-Nov-20,3,"All citizens must be alert about covid-19.Most of the citizens are not wearing Masks, not maintaining social distance. Due to these reasons Covid-19 is not reducing among people. This app is very useful to control covid-19 ,because it alerts the peron who d uses this app-- Ramana VTV.","CT Department of Public HealthDecember 1, 2020Ramana - This app is configured to help you be aware ! It stores a record if your are within 6 ft. of another installed app for 15 minutes. If anyone on your list is tested positive then you will be alerted. Hopefully this will stay quiet for you !! Thank you for doing your part ! ** SMcC DPH Admin **"
Michael Lillis,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,15-Nov-20,12,"Seems like they did a good job to make this as anonymous as possible. no permissions are required by the app, which is really nice.","CT Department of Public HealthNovember 26, 2020Michael - This is completely anonymous and your identity is protected. Thank you for participating !! ** SMcC DPH Admin **"
Ray,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,26-Nov-20,11,"This app is a hoax 😉 Update: I forgot that I wrote the above ""review"" until I got a response from the developer. I just want to say thank you for everything you are doing. This app is a great idea. Keep up the good work! I probably should have kept my original tongue in cheek ""review"" to myself.","CT Department of Public HealthNovember 26, 2020John - Most scientific evidence does not come to the same conclusion.

David Cooper,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,28-Nov-20,6,Great app. Glad to see CT dept of health participating in this notification system. Be a patriot and wear a mask. It will save lives and prevent the need for further lock downs. No permissions needed.

Eric Throndson,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,14-Nov-20,24,"I researched how this app works and I'm very comfortable with the way it protects privacy. I am curious though, if I'm around someone from another state that has their state's app and they get covid, will I get notified?","CT Department of Public HealthNovember 26, 2020Eric - Yes, this is completely anonymous. It is all being coordinated though the APHL servers so If their App has you listed as being with in the proximity threshold (as defined by that state DPH), you will be notified when the positive test is reported in that state. **SMcC DPH App Admin **"
Jill Stanley,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,1-Dec-20,2,I just downloaded the app I hope I like it and it helps to keep us safe or lets us know how to better besides disinfectant spray,"CT Department of Public HealthDecember 1, 2020Jill - Thank you for helping and doing your part ! ** SMcC DPH Admin **"

Bobby Moniz,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,1-Dec-20,3,"I live in Taunton, MA & don't travel much. Is it OK to use this until Massachusetts releases one if at all? If it's useless unless I am in or near CT please let me know and I'll uninstall it.","CT Department of Public HealthDecember 1, 2020Bobby - This App will still work to tell you who you are close to, and be notified if someone else you are around from CT tests positive, but if YOU test positive the key can only be triggered by the CT Department of Public Health. As as a Mass resident we would not know your notification key. Thank you for your support. ** SMcC DPH Admin **"
