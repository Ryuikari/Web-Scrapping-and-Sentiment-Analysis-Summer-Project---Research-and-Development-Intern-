bruce needleman,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,1-Apr-21,62,"The app is really only useful if widely used. Much like the new Excelsior pass, if it's use is not mandated or widely used voluntarily, it is essentially useless.",
Ms Tiffany,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,11-Apr-21,46,Worthless app. does not work. People close to me are now dying from Covid and this worthless app helped no one. It drains battery on bluetooth and that's all it does. I am however fully vaccinated. UNINSTALLED,
Paulo Bud,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,5-Apr-21,27,"The app is a great idea, but it's useless because no one is using it. It should be mandatory. I'll uninstall because it does not work with only 500K installs.",
John Kim,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,18-May-21,4,This app is useless and doesn't work. I was positive for covid but it didn't notify my gf who also had the app. None of the Healthcare providers or health departments seem to know about this app.,
Eugene Han,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,25-Mar-21,72,Lacking in functionality to inform users... Doesn't link outside the app to get additional up-to-date information and directives from government agencies.,
Steven Gabris,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,11-Feb-21,191,"Caused 6 other apps to fail and stop working. Uninstalled from phone, but still getting this apps notifications when Bluetooth is disabled. Very disappointed. Not recommended.",
Subwayplay 92,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,3-Mar-21,142,Invasive use of solicitation to user by recommending via notification outside of the app store. I should not be getting push notifications that override my settings for these to be unable to do so. Google and affiliates are invading users privacy by doing so.,
Ravy Gravy,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,3-Mar-21,109,"App can be manipulated for false positives. After providing symptoms, it tells me unfortunately and I may have Covid-19, yet these symptoms are for a different diagnosis that someone like myself deals with due to other health reasons. So basically this app is not fool proof and cannot be taken seriously. I'm now uninstalling it and hope that no residue applications within the app has been left behind in my device as some apps do leave behind unwanted features. Use at your own discretion",
Rayad Khan,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,22-Mar-21,68,"Uninstalling this app as it doesn't seem to actually be used by any NYC contact tracing group. When I tested positive for covid, neither of the two contact tracing officials brought it up or could give me a code to notify people I was in contact with. What was the point lol?",
Tukkun Nizura,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,4-Feb-21,64,my bluetooth always on cause my wireless ear buds. I work in a clinic that does covid testing and people who have symptoms for covid. not 1 notification.,
First Name Last Name,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,27-Feb-21,20,Pointless if no one else uses it. At this point I trust other people as far as the magic yellow lines in the road.,
* USA *,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,11-Feb-21,57,"This is stupid. Google the CDC weekly flu numbers and you'll see all these Covid numbers are actually flu. There's 23 total flu for 1 week in USA but a billion covid cases? Bullcrap. They just want to do ""the great reset"" .",
Michael Kolberg,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,9-Apr-21,3,The only alert I got from this app was when I turn my Bluetooth off at home. I constantly get the notification telling me it can't check for exposures. I spent a while work day with someone that just came off quarantine and didn't get a notification then. There's too many variables for this to be useful and the constant bluetooth notifications were just annoying.,
Antonio Caia,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,23-Apr-21,3,Waste of space. Waste of memory. Useless,
regina connors,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,27-Apr-21,1,"This did nothing for anyone in suburban and rural communities in New York State. A great idea, but a waste of time.",
Midnight Hoss,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,29-May-21,1,"Nobody has ever died of covid 19. It is fake. If you use this app, you're a knuckle dragger.",
Carrie Nunyabidness,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,15-Dec-20,121,"Says my Bluetooth is off, but it is on (following the link to settings changes nothing) and the only other option is to turn it off. I have no idea how this app works because I was under the impression it was working this whole time and can't turn Bluetooth on when it already is on. BT works fine for my headphones its weird that this app says its not on.",
Emilie Dishongh,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,17-Dec-20,0,"I just get an error to check my network connection (which is fully functional), and it won't finish setup. I've tried downloading and installing multiple times over a couple months. Oh well.",
Hendogbx,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,18-May-21,0,No place to download im fully vaciantated app or passport,
T Newman,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,27-Jan-21,8,"We had the app and have since deleted it. We caught Covid. There is no way to state so in the app. You need to wait for the Health Dept to do something with it. By the time we received a call from the HD (poor staff are so over worked because people are careless!) we were almost off quarantine, so they didn't bother doing anything with the app or contact tracing (which we had already done on our own anyway). The app was a waste! Totally defeated the purpose of it.",
Filip V.,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,26-Dec-20,38,"I give it 1 star and a thumb up, that's for all information you can find on this app. But I can't give more stars because the most important feature of this app is to let others know that you get tested for Covid, but it doesn't work! The code you are supposed to get from a Trace worker doesn't work, so the app can't (anonymously) send out important information and contact other people or their devices... (I reinstalled the app, turned of/on bluetooth, and tried multiple codes = nothing worked)",
Paul Camman,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,15-Apr-21,1,I want to register my covid-19 vaccines and this site does not allow me.,
B Nguyen,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,3-Mar-21,4,"App can be manipulated for false positives. After providing symptoms, it tells me unfortunately and I may have Covid-19, yet my symptoms are for a different diagnosis that someone like myself deals with daily due to other health reasons. So basically this app is not fool proof and cannot be taken seriously. I'm now uninstalling it and hope that no residue applications within the app has been left behind in my device as some apps do leave behind unwanted features. Use at your own discretion.",
David O'Brien-Davis,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,4-Mar-21,11,"This app is full of security holes. Leaves your Bluetooth open to vulernability. It's a great concept, but I work from home and I'd rather not risk (more) identity theft",
Mike J,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,26-Dec-20,6,"I'm a part time uber driver and food truck employee & this app definitely does not work. I deal with hundreds of people on a daily basis. And I never gotten a notification,, either people are lying or contact tracing does not work and a waste of tax paper money",
Sean Kennedy,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,15-Oct-20,10,"Bluetooth voice profile issue. As soon as this was installed (pixel 4xl with Android 11), all the ""voice"" profiles disappeared from my Bluetooth devices, audio remained so I could listen to music but could not hear or send voice calls over the device (ex car bluetooth, headset, etc). This essentially makes it a non starter for me. Disappointing. As soon as I uninstalled this app, all my problems went away.",
Chris Wilkinson,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,17-Jan-21,6,App is completely useless . I drive through all five boroughs and went through Brooklyn along Williamsburg and saw hundreds of people with no masks on in a certain neighborhood and my phone didn't ring once but it's a covid hot spot. Then I went to uptown Washington heights and Dyckman and it didn't ring once either there.,
Niti Lashka,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,25-Jan-21,4,It was working fine initially. After another update it took out the mortality rate. And now everybody is concerned about vaccine and it is not going to cover it. What is the point of this application at this time?,
Tabitha Davis,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,10-Dec-20,4,"Does not give updated information that is needed of positive cases in the area. Requires a code to be given out when you become a positive case. Not very descriptive and helpful into preventing the covid-19 issue . It also disrupts the use of other apps. For example messenger, facebook, and the use of your own wi-fi. While this app is running, shows on messenger for example that has to wait for the network to connect before it will work. Not a very good app needs more updates.",
Loretta S. H.,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,16-Oct-20,20,"Automatically turns on GPS location on Android devices, kills battery on s20 ultra (which is very hard to do regularly), and constantly notifies you to turn on your GPS when you turn it off when it clearly states that it uses Bluetooth. The fact that it does not use the tracker is not the point, it's the fact that the GPS locator itself drains your battery so conserve on battery it stays off so unless you can find a way to actually use the Bluetooth in Android devices this app is useless here.",
Jennifer Plante,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,5-Oct-20,11,"Just downloaded the app and it will not even open for me. Every time I try to open the app I get the same thing. I get booted right as soon as I try to access it. It really sounds like it is a good app to have and I hope the developers can update it and make it work properly, but until then I have to give 1 ★. Uninstalling now.",
Joshua Scarselli,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,24-Mar-21,2,It never alerted me to anything. Bet it just says on us.,
James Mitchell,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,14-Dec-20,18,I been around people who had covid and they have this app and everything but not showed that people i was around had it. But i will say that i am lucky that i have got it yet. I have been around 6 people so far that had it or has it. Time to get rid of this app. I dont need to track hie many people have it in my county. Thats all this app is really good for is to see the status of the covid in your county.,
James Shoemaker,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,27-Jan-21,16,Why can't I use this with another COVID exposure notification app? I live near both NY and CT. This should definitely be something to consider. Terrible. I have to pick one state.,
Anna Castillo,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,24-Nov-20,44,"Cant really use it for now. Bluetooth on and when I try to set it up ,the button for closeness alert won't work. I even uninstalled the app and reinstalled same thing. I really would like to be alerted. Please help. I have emailed also. I will change my rating once the app works for me. Thank you.",
Francoi Francoi,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,8-Nov-20,3,"As I said in my last review,my speaker worked fine after possibly being muted for a month when I uninstalled this app. There is nothing concerning in this app neither a virus or malware, but you can get your speaker muted for free by installing this. Just wrote another because I'm still wondering where my original review went.",
Ian Scheil,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,1-Oct-20,712,"App is vulnerable and open to code manipulation and attacks via Bluetooth vulnerabilities. Scans via Indeoendsnt analysis software find vulnerabilities that can expose your personal device to attackers. Great idea, but the security is highly flawed for the time being until certain patches are developed by device manufacturers and app developers.",
Autumn-Diana Standingwolf,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,26-Nov-20,40,"Dosen't Work, No Support. I click turn on & nothing happens. Bluetooth is on. NFC on. Uninstalled/reinstalled. Updated my phone. Installed again same problem. I wrote the developer over 4 days ago no response. Only an automated message: thanks for doing your part to stop the spread. SGS9.",
D H,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,5-Jan-21,18,Does not work in conjunction with other covid apps. Must shut one off to use the other. Have NY and Connecticut. They will not work at the same time. Stupid!,
Stuart Rasch,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,27-Dec-20,17,"Useless.. i work doing COVID testing have yet to have the application alert me of a contact, yet I see many people every day who have tested positive.",
Lupine Dream,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,18-Oct-20,14,"I have seasonal allergies. Simply answering that i have a stuffy nose that i get every year on the seasonal transition between fall and winter gives me a ""You might have COVID-19, stay indoors"" message. Self assessment tool is broken. 1 star for neglecting to fix such a vital feature so that it's accurate. At least ask if we have preliminary conditions before worrying us or falsely flagging us. Negative COVID-19 test.",
Bryan Ludgate,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,26-Jan-21,12,Local health department has no access to the code required when tested positive. App is useless if the health department cannot use it.,
mark uhl,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,20-Dec-20,28,"there is no way to notify anyone if you contract covid. the app instructs to enter a code provided by someone who will call if ur test is positive. nobody called, not even after i sent a note asking for help. its now been 10 days since my PCR lab report. whats the point of building and releasing this and asking people to use it if the data isnt ever going to be used for anything? im just going to uninstall it cos its just eats my battery for no public benefit.",
Kevin Sim,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,1-Nov-20,27,"Google Exposure Notification API is not available on secondary profiles on the same Google device. Also not really useful since most people that really should be using this - schools, clinics, barbers, etc. - are not, and have not heard of this app!",
A O,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,1-Oct-20,110,"I'm super-pro-mask & virus safety, but can confirm other comment - app will make your phone vulnerable to bluetooth hacking. Also, be aware bluetooth & Location Services must be on 24/7 to work. Location tracking may be a worthwhile tradeoff for saving lives & finding hotspots, but I permanently disabled Location on my phone for privacy concerns, so this app will not work for me. Please be aware of the risks, mask up, social distance, & wash your hands.",
J.,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,26-Nov-20,19,"The app seems like it'd be useful, and I really wish I could use it. Unfortunately, it won't let me turn on alerts. No matter how many times I tap the button to turn on alerts, absolutely nothing happens. Disappointing.",
Raymond Kong,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,10-Oct-20,118,"If you watch this review because you have privacy concern against this app. I can tell you that.... there is ""no concern"". I confirm the app has no access to any personal info in your phone. I use third party product to scan it and confirm this. The application design really ensure that you cannot be tracked. Your privacy is safe. So, go ahead to download it to increase protection for youself.",
Good as Gold,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,3-Mar-21,11,Wake up to the scam. Who has died? No one dieing in the streets. And flu seemed to disappear. Go to CDC.gov website to see the real numbers. Don't believe me.,
Arturo Verticchio,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,26-Oct-20,9,"Propaganda, control: This app makes it easier for your overlords to trace where you have been and what you have been doing. You will submit to them and you will only learn the things that they want you to learn (because the only things that happen are on the news, right?). You will only be safe if they keep you safe, you can't keep yourself safe. 99% of people get better from this disease but this is the first time in human history that we have forced control over a population in this way.",
Jacob Goldbaum,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,5-Feb-21,4,I love Quomo he is the best NYC mayor in the last 20 years. He is the sexyist hottest e boy president. Love the app. App gave covid only to Karen. App very hot and sexy. Unfortunately not enough BBC.,
david Finley,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,10-Oct-20,11,BATTERY KILLER! I have a phone that can last approximately one week off of one charge. After installing this app the phone would only last approximately 6-8 hours and now takes 3 hours to charge instead of 40 minutes. This app literally destroyed my phone.,
Shelby Leipold,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,8-Nov-20,4,"I had this app, feeling like it was my duty as a New Yorker to help where I could, but after realizing that my county was withholding numbers and not fully reporting the positive cases, I uninstalled it.",
Hades Yoworld,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,17-Oct-20,20,It wouldn't stop telling me to download it via the play store notifications no matter how many times I cleared it. Within an hour it showed up again. So I only downloaded it to give this review. And hopefully this will stop the damn notifications.,
Barbara Perry,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,5-May-21,0,"Great idea, but not widely used, therefore useless. Now fully vaccinated, uninstalling.",
Martina Montes Rodriguez,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,1-Oct-20,88,I have no doubt that this is good BUT I do not like that even if you choose ONE symptom let's say Headache or even congestion or runny nose it straight up tells you that you may have covid. Like what if I have a headache period or a sinus infection. Dont like it wont use it,
Leung Cheung Li,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,13-Oct-20,32,"Idea behind the app is great, but this only works if EVERYONE downloads it and does their due diligence of reporting covid. Released for 3 weeks, only 100k+ downloads(not sure if this includes apple side). If people care that much to go through the motions of reporting, putting on a mask shouldn't be an issue on the first place.",
Junior's Digital Designs,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,21-Oct-20,2,"Idk, not impressed at all. If its supposed to be designed to do one thing, its sure not doing it. Just asks you mostly about your current health stats thats it. 😒 I was hoping it really detects when such a people has it.",
li le,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,2-Oct-20,120,The reviews are a bunch of bots claiming that the app works right but it does not. Currently it's October 2 and the inapp information has not been updated since September 29. So I'm currently 2 days with outdated information.,
Samantha Cocchi,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,2-Nov-20,6,"I didn't download this crapware spyware.... how did it get on my phone app?!?!? This was never downloaded by me, this was pushed on to my phone without my authorization.... You need to kick this abusive app developer off of the platform and never allow them back on",
Bobby Accord,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,3-Dec-20,3,"It keeps running in the background and running the battery life down on my phone Not cool at all , I realize Covid-19 is serious and it's good to know if someone is exposed but why run the app all the time in the background it serves no purpose other than killing the battery life of my phone .",
Ez Atkinson,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,5-Dec-20,37,Was around someone who tested positive and was in a cluster area and get no alert. This app does not work. You all must be collection other information from my phone but it sure was not covid19 information,
Keith White,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,6-Nov-20,2,"Keeps telling me that tracking is turned off, but when I click on the notification, it is turned on.",
Red Blue,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,26-Nov-20,2,I like the idea but I says some people test positive for the virus but that got tested and did not test positive see if maby this is a glich I would be nice to be fixed cus I love this thix for making it possible for us all,
Anthony Cassera,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,22-Oct-20,24,Waste of time and storage space. What's the point of an app that only transmits data from the phone and never anything useful to the phone? Uninstalling and not looking back.,
tommosm,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,31-Dec-20,15,I installed this months ago. I have yet to get any notifications. I guess it's busted.,
Taylorcrawford Walker,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,7-Oct-20,25,Takes entirely too long to load; I uninstalled in less than a week and might give it another try later.,
Peter MacMillan,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,19-Oct-20,6,App would be a great idea if it didn't drain your battery and use all your data all the time. I like the idea just not the abuse of resources.,
brian fimple,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,15-Dec-20,14,Reported false positive exposure on day I quarantined at home alone all day. No option in app or hotline to report false exposure notice.,
Arthur Barbato,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,5-Oct-20,17,"As a tracker, alert system it is a zero. Don't waste your time or battery.",
Toss Toad,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,10-Oct-20,31,The app is overall a trick. They already are tracking what they need to know. I just love puzzles.,

Yang Su,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,19-Dec-20,12,"The installation is not mandatory, so the app is pretty much just placebo.",
Thomas Eddy,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,12-Dec-20,3,I'm curious on how anyone could defend this app when it violate HIPAA laws. If you go into a doctor's office and the secretary shows you her screen with someone else's name on the computer that's actually a violation of HIPAA laws so how is this not face it this app is illegal and should be removed as soon as possible or should be prosecuted to the full extent of the law,
Kenneth Dehn,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,29-Nov-20,1,No good you click on your county and shows rate but the rate is not true the news you watch reports other numbers what is the true numbers nobody knows hope by next year after vaccines come out we be back by summer or winter,

Roy Fischman,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,5-Oct-20,17,"The app says that if it is installed and the app user comes in contact with someone who is positive for covid the app user will be alerted. What method does the app use to alert the app user. Is there an audio alert, or some other way?",

Perilous Gmail,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,18-Nov-20,95,"Update: Dev continues completely tone-deaf, as evidenced by their reply below, which has ZERO to do with my review. Nowhere did I do so much as insinuate that the app was for medical diagnosis. I know exactly what the app is meant to do, & insulting my intelligence is not going to hide the fact that the app is useless & does not do the job. They still haven't fixed anything. Literally thousands of complaints similar to mine & they still don't get it. The entire point is that chronically ill people ALREADY HAVE BASELINE SYMPTOMS, and if those aren't entered into ANY tracing application, the RESULTS WILL BE WRONG. How are you allowed to work on this app or respond to questions without that basic understanding? This is very definition of ableist trash. I stand by my original review: Absolutely worthless garbage. They don't listen & things keep getting worse. Inexcusable incompetence. I dont want your lying responses, I want you to do your job or get out of the way so someone who can has the chance to fix your mess. This is ridiculous. *** Original review: How can you possibly do anything like this without first allowing for a person's baseline health? I've got chronic conditions that share C19 symptoms. This app now thinks I've got C19. This is thoughtless, ableist, privileged foolishness. Throwing the chronically ill under the bus, as always. Why do you refuse to learn? Uninstalled. I want to be part of the solution, but your ignorant gatekeeping shuts me out. Nice job.","New York State Department of HealthOctober 5, 2020We appreciate your feedback.

Dennis Penglase,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,4-Oct-20,36,"Um? HIPPA Laws? Privacy Laws that guideline the use of a patient's medical information??? ANYONE ever heard of these things? So let's get this straight. If I'm in a room with one other person for a half hour and then directly go into a room all by myself. Then the app informs me that I've been six feet next to someone who's tested positive. Explain to me just EXACTLY where this protects the privacy of that person who I now know, thanks to this app, has tested positive? A VERY SLIPPERY SLOPE!!!",

NY UK,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,8-Dec-20,7,"So you expect me to believe that people who test positive for the plague, are actually going to be honest & record their data, then go out against the rules and let you track them? Do you delete the info after 2 weeks or keep warning people 3 months later? If it doesn't alert someone immediately, then all you're doing is feeding fear into peoples' minds by sending the ""warning"" later. What's the point in this? So everyone here is staying home any time a warning pops up? If not, why have this?",
Hannah Kanouse,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,4-Oct-20,26,This app is a scam. They are just trying to collect data. My device stalled after the install and I barely got my device working again.

Tamara Thomas,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,23-Mar-21,2,"Kind of useless. Relies too much on self reporting, which doesn't tell me anything about my risk of exposure from others. If users who are diagnosed with COVID-19 don't self report, the need for this app becomes null. Also, if they don't have location services on, that also doesn't help at all.",
Ken Richner,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,22-Apr-21,1,Useless when you live in PA on the NY border and your shopping is in NY the app won't let you use it if you also have the PA app loged in? I have to remember to log out of PA to log into NY when I drive into NY it's only 5 miles to the NY border I live in a very remote area of PA nothing here but I do drive into town to a Walmart 25 miles away from me in PA these apps are useless to those living on the state borders!,
Hanzo Garushia,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,4-Mar-21,2,"The App appears to have the right concept, but when it comes to what people want to use it for it irrelevant. If I use it I want it to tell me if my working location is safe, not to find out that it's only collecting information. To many cases are showing up around my job, and were finding out by people calling out. We need a tool that is more essential, with a Covid report button.",
Eric Ptak,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,18-Oct-20,9,"I like the idea of an app like this a lot. It's not that I go out in public often, and being notified of a possible exposure is good. However, on my Pixel 3XL, performance went into the toilet, and the battery drain was insane. Normally, I could listen to YouTube music while working out in my basement and only go down to 85-90% from a full charge. With this installed, it drops to 25-30% in an hour. It also caused recharge times to increase dramatically. Fix that issue, and I will reinstall.",
Ron Coyne,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,20-Oct-20,9,"IMO, this is something which should be done on a national platform, and incorporated into Google, so all smartphone users have this information. Instead, this app is quite large, not moveable to the SD card, and forces you to use Bluetooth more often than is wise... not only for battery life, but vulnerability issues. Also, the ""questionnaire"" of daily symptoms blows quite the dog whistle, flipping out over a stuffy nose, practically equating it with a positive COVID diagnosis. Too many bugs to be worked out for my liking... sorry. Uninstalled.",
Richard Hooker,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,3-Oct-20,187,"Not sure how good it is yet. But I know it sucks the life out if my better. As the Bluetooth searches for a device and is unable too, my Samsung S9+ last week before installing the app would get close to 20 hours on a charge, now after installing this app, I get about 8 hours on a charge and the phone is down to 18%.",
Ed S,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,7-Oct-20,32,Good but not enough. Data is several days behind. There should be a way to log in if you had a test and log the results. The symptoms tracker does not allow you to quantify symptoms like a runny nose.. what if I have hay fever? This app needs some serious refining to be worthwhile.,
NJ GB,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,7-Nov-20,1,concept is good. alas even with bluetooth on it didn't work. then again most of the people in my neighborhood refuse to get tested (I get tested) and/or aren't tech savvy so this app isn't useful for my neighborhood,
Michael Williams,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,8-Nov-20,11,"More work on the app is needed. Despite enabling Bluetooth, the app still ask for you to do so; then it hangs. Keep work on it.",
Anabelle Jimenez,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,11-Oct-20,100,"I'm worried as to its accuracy. I'm still waiting for my COVID-19 results, which I'm expecting since around September 24. I haven't felt sick, but given the high amount of asymptomatic carriers idk how reliable this app would be with so many people out on the streets without any knowledge of being infected due to irresponsible testing measures in the city. And yes, I've tried to call several times. No answer and they keep hanging up the phone.",
Peter M,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,5-Oct-20,7,I had to uninstall it because my phone was no longer able to connect to my Bose Soundlink mini II bluetooth speaker. I hope the next version fixes this since i believe that this alert app is a useful method of contact tracing.,
DJ S,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,3-Oct-20,28,"If the app has not been updated for proximity sensing to work on a Samsung Galaxy 10, then why did they make this available? What's the point of installing this when the main purpose doesn't work?",
Keith,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,13-Oct-20,4,I would like to keep this app installed but I think it was causing my phone a lot of issues. My phone kept forgetting bluetooth devices until I uninstalled this.,
Nassim Sabba,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,22-Nov-20,16,"Two stars because: It is a shame that only just over 100k people have downloaded this app in a city of 8.4 million and a state of 12 million.

Michele Real,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,7-Jun-21,3,"Didnt have any issues with app. I logged my symptoms or lack there of about every other day. I uninstalled the app due to the fact that it never did anything, minus the monthly alert to tell me I have the app. I got no notifications I was close to someone who had covid. Nothing to improve my daily life around covid or to try to protect me. Basically, it's just the state taking my info but providing nothing in return. Not a shock when it comes to NY.",
Kenneth Crosby,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,31-Mar-21,92,"I never had any issues with the app functionality but, it was not useful to me in any way. No alerts or information to help me stay informed or safe. It has not improved my life or proved to be a valuable tool during COVID-19 in any way.",
Jay Kay,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,11-Apr-21,32,"Could be good if more people used it. Unfortunately for my battery, I can't afford to have Bluetooth on all day so I pretty much can't use this app. Only when plugged I but I can't have it plugged in when I'm public so...",
J D,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,21-Feb-21,102,"I have it installed. With such an allegedly important tool that could save life's it really is discouraging that it only relies 9n Bluetooth.

Demetri Ingilis,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,15-Dec-20,186,"Just tested positive. Tried to send a notification to all codes I've come into contact with and app requires 6 digit code from a contact tracer. 1. So I'm going to sit here not being able to notify anyone until a contact tracer calls me? A day can mean the difference between life and death. 2. Give us the option to edit our symptoms today. I usually do it in the morning but developed a symptom this afternoon but it was too late, I had already submitted for the day.",
Kelsey Ballance,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,1-Jan-21,34,"The closeness sensing won't work if your phone is in battery saver mode (at least with my phone). If your Bluetooth + location are both on and you're still getting errors, try turning off battery saver/power saving mode.",
Cherokee Wilber,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,5-Jan-21,56,"All of these apps need to work together, not try to supercede each other. People who travel should not need to switch which app is doing sensing depending on which state they are in. If this is the fault of state health departments, they need to stop the bickering and all work together",
Monica,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,5-Jan-21,22,"I will say, recently in our area we've had an outbreak. The app was scanning daily to see if anyone in the vicinity had reported symptoms. This will only work if everyone down loads this and enters symptoms or lack thereof often.",
Gregory Eaton,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,3-Oct-20,466,"The idea behind this app is great. There is a running list of travel quarantine states in the NYS website, which this app does not include. It contains safety tips as well. It should also have a dark theme. The fact that Bluetooth needs to be on in order for the proximity alerts to work is not ideal. I feel this is an unnecessary security risk and that using cell tower triangulation is just as effective and requires less battery to operate.",
John Karahalis,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,17-Nov-20,335,"I installed this app 3 months ago and tested positive for the novel coronavirus 1 month ago. I was excited to warn nearby contacts of my status from the app, but doing so requires a secret 6-digit code and the contact tracer who was assigned to my case did not know what it was. I was so disappointed. My phone had collected 2 months of data about nearby contacts, but this information could not be used to save lives. I don't blame the contact tracer, but I hope this issue can be addressed.",
Dave L,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,9-Dec-20,192,I understand privacy but for this app to truly work.... work related we make house calls but ask a series of questions before we enter the home. They can easily lie and say no. It be nice that the GPS (Location) when on and at a house can notify you of a positive person in that household or residence or a location address. That information is out there vs relaying on someone else phone and hoping they have the app to talk.,
Mitch Enderby,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,3-Dec-20,98,"Could be more useful and informative. Details related to current current zone level and useful misc subjects should be added. User provided information to include self reporting of testing, type of testing, postive/false-positive/negative results, and self/state/organization/employer imposed quarantine. Application update/""whats new"" information needs to be detailed, rather than a general out of date blanket statement describing the application.",
Sandi Rosenbaum,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,2-Oct-20,71,"Kept telling me I need to turn on Bluetooth although every possible Bluetooth setting was already enabled.. The issue turned out to be that Location also needs to be on - doesn't say this anywhere - and also that Battery Saver was creating a problem. Finally, successful setup! Now to see how well it works.",
D T,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,4-Oct-20,44,"While I appreciate this app and it's goal, the symptom tracker needs some tweaking. One of my chronic health issues shares symptoms with COVID and therefore flags me as potentially having COVID. I've seen others in the reviews have this issue too. Maybe something can be done to fix this?","New York State Department of HealthOctober 6, 2020Thank you for your feedback. This is currently being looked into. The use of My Health Log is completely optional, and the feedback that the app provides upon logging of any symptoms is not a medical diagnosis of any kind."
Juliana Q,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,25-Oct-20,181,"I assume it does what it says it does, but it's also caused panic in a bunch of people I know because for example I put in fatigue this morning and it was like YOU MIGHT HAVE COVID. And that caused a panic attack. I'm going to keep it installed so that I can be notified and stuff, but I talked to my doctor and he agreed that I shouldn't look at it so that I don't have daily panic attacks over what's probably nothing.",
T B,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,28-Feb-21,1,"This app works if ""EVERYONE"" follow the procedure. And are truthful.",
L C,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,11-Oct-20,13,A suggestion. It would be nice to mark a designated location as no one is coming in or out so the app can take a break for purpose of saving phone battery.,
Stephanie Oddo,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,22-Oct-20,5,just installed it seems like it could be a good way to find out if your around people that have been infected but as long as everyone has the app installed and you have your Bluetooth on so you can be notified 🤷‍♀️,
Mike S,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,15-Nov-20,5,"Assume this app works, but haven't had any alerts. Also the symptoms are similar to common cold and allergies so that may cause alarm to people.",

ERA Triano,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,30-Oct-20,10,"Good probably, but SILLY. it asks how you're feeling, and when I checked the box for a runny nose it gave me a ""sorry you're not feeling well"" page, complete with ""could be COVID19"" warnings. Ridiculous.",
Haruko Ishikawa,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,3-Oct-20,13,Like the love alarm app but the opposite way around xD. Nice app tho to stay safe. Another difference than the love alarm is that this app won't bring people together. Love alarm a serie on Netflix. Just got the connection haha. But again nice app,
Suzanne Weiner,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,5-Nov-20,8,"Wish this had an ""I tested negative"" button for people with symptoms that turn out to be unrelated. Also, I suspect this gives a false sense of security--the main threat is people who don't take this seriously. Those people aren't using this app.",

Andrew Crowder,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,16-Feb-21,203,"It's a well designed app and is useful even if only for a convenient way to keep an eye on the charts. Of course the fact that it's opt-in is a limitation, but I really don't understand the complaints on this. People are saying they've never gotten an exposure notification like it's a bad thing.

Easy to install and I like the updates. I wish it would ask for some kind of basic health history. I, too, had Covid-19 months ago and am still experiencing relapses at various times. I don't want to be labeled as having Covid-19 while in the middle of a relapse. Can that be worked into the app?",
Claire Cramer,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,9-Oct-20,175,"Very happy with this app. My friend told me he doesn't have the newest version of his iOS & can't download it. Seems like we will miss a lot of people this way. Also, would be helpful to have a link to the new cluster map integrated. Everything else is wonderful. Easy to use, visually elegant, multiple languages available. I like the health log as well. ETA: After reading other reviews, I have to say it's affecting my battery life at all, & alerts are anonymous and delayed. Explains in the app!",
Elijah Anthony,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,1-Oct-20,331,"Cool app my only issue is if you select any of the symptoms you are told to stay home. I understand the abundance of caution, but you can have some of those symptoms and not have COVID-19. My suggestion is unless it is a symptom such as loss of taste/smell or something more specific to COVID-19 one should not be told to stay home.",
Matthias Hess,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,3-Oct-20,23,Good app but needs broader compatibility if we're to get a critical mass of users. Easy setup with no account or registration. Everyone who thinks this is some sort of tracking conspiracy should just get rid of their cell phone altogether.,
Robin Dickens,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,2-Oct-20,32,"4 stars based only on what I've read about the process & the security/privacy aspects, so far. But if this app can in any way help prevent NYC having to again witness bodies being loaded from rear of hospitals into multiple refrigerated tractor trailer trucks, I'm going to try it. Happily. P.S. Privacy is pretty much an illusion these days anyway, so..",
Leesa Sage,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,22-Oct-20,10,It lets me report symptoms and logg them. It needs to have the tracing for everybody however. I need to know which areas have covid not which people which are few have the app and who I know of these that download it's zero. People aren't responsible enough and too paranoid to help others. Great attempt on the apps behalf however.,
Bill Spielman,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,22-Apr-21,0,Seems ok to improve intervention without excess battery drain.,
Charlotte Dion,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,3-Oct-20,8,I live in NJ and have already installed their tracking app. I installed the NY app as suggested by Gov. Cuomo because a lot of New Yorkers travel through my area. Seems you can only have one app or the other active. Have the states coordinated technology so I only need one app that will cover both states?,"New York State Department of HealthOctober 5, 2020NY is working with NJ to ensure that the app will work across state lines.

mary ann sekely,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,2-Oct-20,36,I have asthma and allergies. So I have shortness of breath occasionally. This should also be noted in the symptoms checking. It is misleading to associate all shortness of breath with Covid19.,

I hope we can all stay honest, Together, and ready. We will lose loved ones. I'm worried this app being used for people want justice after losing someone, grief comes out in all ways. I just hope we can come together as a country, help each other, not blame each other for loss of loved ones. If we stay honest and stay together and united we can beat this. Only if we come together",

I feel like I'm the only one using this app in my area. I do turn on Bluetooth when I leave my home. *For me the only useful part of this app is the info on stats. I wonder if they advertised this app along with V-SAFE (online app) and others, if more people would even know about this app and download it. That's the only way this app will work is if others know about it and download it.",

Aquarius Born,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,9-Jan-21,169,12/26 I got an alert that someone was close to me for a prolonged time with Covid. The worst part was getting tested which seemed like it was more difficult then it needed to be and finding a testing cite was annoying and Imo this is a PUBLIC health crisis and ALL testing should be free. I had to go to a place and pay for a test. I was satisfied with this app because I was warned! So for that I'm happy. I was able to be proactive. I was negative in the end so this worked at least for me.,
Matthew C,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,2-Oct-20,703,"Overall, this is a great, simple app. It does what it sets out to do. The hacking concerns are unfounded. After the February patch,, older Androids are doing well. Newer was already very hard to. In response to another comment, it recommends you stay home if you have one of the symptoms listed. There is no true ""COVID-specific"" symptom. Some have just diarrhea or rash as their first symptom. SARS-cov-2 creates a viral syndrome and this differs person to person.",
Andrew P.,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,2-Oct-20,475,"Solid app. The Bluetooth exposure is very minimal and very very hard to hack. You would be more vulnerable to hacks if you wore a smartwatch with or without the app. The only minor complaint I have is the recommendations being off, but it is only a recommendation and it is not shared with anyone. Only time anything is sent is if you test positive and you get a call from an agent with the Department of Health and they give you a code. I hope this app will make a difference and I expect it to",
Age Mycek,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,21-Nov-20,146,"Simple, Easy, and Fast. The ""Covid Alert NY"" app is simply fantastic. I've been using the app for over 2 months now and I don't have any complaints with the app. This app will notify me if I come into contact with anyone who has tested positive for Coronavirus. Another great aspect of the app is it gives me up-to-date information on all positve and negtive Covid-19 test in New York State. The app breaks down the data for the whole state and also shows you your Local County data too. 5 Star app.",
Jeremy Wilner,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,15-Oct-20,346,"Decent information, but not nearly enough, which is fine considering that is a secondary function. This app is perfect in theory, though a significant amount of the population would have to download it, and keep bluetooth on, to see benefits. People need to embrace this for any real benefits. Also, to everybody giving bad reviews because of bluetooth, go read why bluetooth is the method used before trying to ruin an app. If they chose the alternative, you would probably be up in arms.",
Alex K,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,2-Oct-20,166,"This app uses the Exposure API developed by Apple and Google jointly. If you are within 6 feet of another person with the app for 10 minutes, your phone exchanges a secure Bluetooth token (code) with that person's. Then, if that person gets COVID, you get a notification that you were exposed- because you have their token. There is NO way for this app to see your location. There is NO tracking of your location through the app. It does NOT compromise bluetooth. This app can save lives.",
Holly A Vautrin,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,26-Jan-21,1,I like this app cuz it tells you exactly what covid-19 is about and what when it got here why it got here how it got here and other things that are affiliated with it unfortunately are polishing politicians don't do all that they tell you as little as possible to keep you in the dark they tell you what you need but not everything that you need to hear you find it on the app,
Kyle F,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,7-Oct-20,6,I love living in fear! And with this app along with constant bombardment by the news of the ever growing cases of covid 19 (that I absolutely trust 100%) I can always be reminded that it's never going to be okay! I mean what more could I ask for than to regress to a primal state of survival because the deadliest virus ever (covid 19 of course) is always lurking to kill 9% of America's population? Nine percent! Remember to wear a mask and never question the legitimacy of the covid 19 narrative.,
Maureen,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,11-Oct-20,249,"It's quite a relief having this app. It lets you go about with a little more confidence that no one is near you with Covid. Even for my husband's sake, who's a cab driver upstate and takes full precautions, I don't have to spray Lysol all over him when he walks in the house. There is no invasion of privacy; if someone is near you with Covid you get an alert with a code number. No names at all. Thank you Gov. Cuomo.",
Jes Sorensen,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,2-Oct-20,93,The app is well documented and clearly explains how it works. Spend more than 10 minutes in close proximity with someone else and the apps will exchange a token. No location and other information. All the paranoid scaremongers should read the details before leaving misleading nonsense reviews.,
Dee,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,5-Nov-20,32,The app works. I got notified about being in close contact and was able to narrow down where I was that day. I deleted the app 3 days ago (just cause) and was called today about exposure 11 days ago. Not sure why it took so long to be notified but I appreciate it nonetheless.,
David Wiczer,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,15-Oct-20,20,This implements the Google and Apple bluetooth-based contact tracing. Also provided some nice data on how risks are evolving. It's a really great app and a shame more states (or the federal government) haven't done something similar. They really should advertise it more though.,
Roslyn Fadden,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,14-Nov-20,48,"This app has been working the way it should but this morning the app seems to be a little crazy. It says that bluetooth is off, and it's on, Then also it said my closeness setting is off. I don't know what is going on but the powers to be should fix the problem. Thank you",
BI MI,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,19-Dec-20,11,Nothing to report so I guess that is good. When I go to check see what exposure checks it shows number of keys so for us geeks a detailed explanation of how it works would be nice.,
Holly a Vautrin,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,26-Nov-20,4,I just downloaded this out very interesting. which is app does it will tell you if you've been in contact with somebody with covid-19 through a certain type of code they won't identify you but they will let you know they won't Mark you but they'll let you know period why is it that our system can't just test everybody and eliminate all this in between nonsense. You're wasting your time people are not going to be truthful. And touch base with the health department. I found you very interesting,
Marc Klein,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,3-Oct-20,18,This works similar to the Citizen app. The only difference is that this one shows the charts and graphs. My only concern is that many won't download this because of privacy issues or because they just don't understand.,
Sarah TJ,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,2-Oct-20,62,"To those with chronic illnesses or a symptom or two like a headache: Covid doesn't respect the symptoms of other conditions and diseases. Its symptoms overlap a lot of them. Use common sense. Only note symptoms that are unusual or suddenly more severe. Or don't use that feature at all. You can still use the closeness sensing (or not) or you can just look at the NY data. And this app will not sell your personal info to Putin, send sexts to your boss, or eat your baby.",
boboli509,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,7-Oct-20,21,"A great tool to have during this pandemic. The more users participate, the more accurate the app is in alerting users. Great idea.",
Andreas Pitsillidis,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,1-Oct-20,614,"Do not listen to misleading, clueless reviews.

Dan Maxwell,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,9-Nov-20,7,"The app seems fine. I think it would be good to add some stats about app installs, reports from users, etc. The NJ app has this. Also it has been poorly marketed by Cuomo et al. I'm not sure most NYers know it exists",

How do I tell them that I forgot my password (Again, I just downloaded the app today just about 30 minutes to an hour ago. And how did it get 1 of my 4 email addresses.?)? What password?
