Christine F,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,13-Jun-21,1,App wont open anymore. I saw on the news that some states are beginning to eliminate reporting daily covid numbers due to the high amount of declining cases. This could be why the app isn't working anymore.,
AL G,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,21-Apr-21,47,"This app is becoming increasingly useless as the number of people getting fully vaccinated increases, and as it fails to gather vaccination data. IF THIS CONDITION CONTINUES, I'LL HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO UN-INSTALL THIS APP. I SUGGEST THAT OTHERS DO THE SAME. I suggest changing the data that you gather to include: - vaccination info (if obtained, what type, when #1, when #2, etc) - positive/negative test results - self-reported symptoms. All the above can be very useful public health data.",
Owen Iozzio,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,7-Jun-21,100,Instantly crashes when launching after latest update,
Chris Etler,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,8-Apr-21,30,"Since the app came out only 1500 people have even entered their contact tracing number, despite thousands of cases a day. Without proper contact tracing this app is useless",
Mike Ehrmann,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,3-May-21,40,Stats like deaths and hospitalizations hasn't been updated in a month or more. Other stats are sometimes days late. Information has become useless. What else does this do besides track us?,
T Sab,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,8-May-21,9,"Work in ER, around Covid patients constantly. Never alerted once. So there is clearly not enough user base for this app to be effective.",
Roibeárd Billson,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,8-Mar-21,72,"Still does not work for me. Tried turning off WiFi & Bluetooth—no difference. Gives ""Error 104"" —totally unhelpfull. Uninstalling. For those complaining about vaccine being unavailable, well it is NJ. We don't do anything sensibly. In my area, there 3 websites (State, Atlantic Health & RWJ). All are unconnected, so need register on all 3—and wait. Seriously? 😠",
Donna Phelan,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,1-Mar-21,87,"Ĺeads you to believe it will let you know where to get vaccinated. Nj has the worst system as it relates to vaccines. It so simple, every area code has there own site, if you prove you live in that zip, you can get vaccinated. Its a no brainer, but the state has NO CLUE!!!",
Bonnie Meigs,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,18-Mar-21,21,"Uninstalling. Does not give exposure alerts. I did not update the app to say I had covid, but the state knows and called me. I don't get exposure notifications when I'm at my house. The whole reason I downloaded this was to be notified of possible exposure and I have never gotten a notification ever. Waste of time.",
Daniel MacMahon,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,9-Mar-21,13,"Has ANYONE on this review thread been notified of a positive Covid-19 contact? Anyone? I was encouraged to download and use this app when I was first tested in Union County. I checked in with my status every day, for many months. I have NEVER been notified of a potential Covid-19 exposure. As a first responder, I know that I have been within close contact with dozens of Covid-positive people. I have lost confidence that this is a valid weapon against the continuing pandemic.",
Shawn Roberts,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,21-Mar-21,4,"This app is useless to users. I've been close, very close, to at least 5 people who have all gotten Covid, none of them caused any notification to my app. I also know that the contact tracers were only asking if they knew about the app, not to do anything to trigger the positive notifications. I know notifications are on because I get one monthly to remind me it's running, well, got one monthly, I have since uninstalled it because it's useless to me as an end user.",
J Newt,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,26-Dec-20,112,"Absolutely worthless. Contracted covid from a person that contracted covid while in hospital. The contact tracer was not able to get the 6 digit code I needed for the app. Also Drs are refusing to test likely positive people. There's no way to use the app as intended without a test or a code, don't bother with the invasion of privacy.",
Brian Gallagher,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,1-Jan-21,141,"I tested positive yesterday, but there is no way to tell the app. I can only report symptoms. Apparently I need a 6 digit code from some health department to let the app know I was positive. So until I get that code nobody who was in proximity to me will get a notification and will therefore keep spreading the 'rona.",
Penelope Lopez,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,22-Dec-20,32,"Your ""ENABLE EXPOSURE ALERT"" button has not worked since its launch. Gone into settings > exposure alert > enable and NOTHING. Have an Android phone but know of iPhone users with the same problem. Located in Morris County, NJ. PLEASE FIX THIS!!",
Ines Bosi,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,20-Mar-21,3,Don't work!! Just useless. Deinstalling.,
Mel G,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,21-Dec-20,13,Not very helpful. I've NEVER been alerted of being or coming into contact with someone whose known to have covid19. This app is just an invasion of my privacy!,
R M,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,5-Dec-20,3,"Not very useful. The app only works, if someone who had or has COVID is using it too! It DOES NOT just detect people with Covid and alert you. I uninstalled it after a week of nothing and especially after 5 people tested positive where I work and the app never alerted me! It's really a waste of time.",
Emily Luedeman,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,4-Nov-20,300,Work in an emergency room and downloaded to see how accurate the alerts would be. I assumed I would have to turn off the notification from being alerted to much. To my surprise I haven't been alerted once in over a month of having the app even after being in direct patient care with positive cases.,
Taxey Driver,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,17-Nov-20,66,Not very useful.: 1. You must have and utilize a smart phone 2. You must have it activated 3. You must report your status daily 4. You must be in close contact with an infected person for too long and they must have reported they have symptons 5. Will it be compatable with apps from other states,
Jordan Shi,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,29-Oct-20,50,Cannot even finish setup poor development. Simple alert app should not be inconvenient to use if it is most people won't go through the headache of setting it up. This fix should be top priority. Poor development something like this should be more easily usable.,
Lior Gotian,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,16-Oct-20,63,Graphs of the data are basically useless without the ability to filter on the last 30 days. The data from March-April dominates the plotted ranges which makes it difficult to determine the actual covid cases and deaths that are occurring now.,
Blank Biermanoski,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,3-Oct-20,12,"Once you tap on the option ""Exposure Alert"" to Activate, then you can't turn it off! And so it's using up my Data to perform checks when I'm all alone! I just Uninstalled the thing.","State of New Jersey  ApplicationsOctober 7, 2020Hi Jean, you can turn off Exposure Alerts at any time through settings in the operating system on your phone. The app has no way to access any of your other apps or any of your data besides the random codes it collects from other devices in the area with the app. If you have other questions about how the app works, please email covidapp@doh.nj.gov"
Janet Kazarowski,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,10-Nov-20,3,"I spend most of my time at home, and this app constantly harasses me to turn on my location. I use my phone a lot, and I don't want to waste the battery. This is more inconvenient to me than it is helpful.",
Mayra Amaral,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,2-Oct-20,24,Can't get pass the 2nd screen during the setup process.error code 1002 (Your Data page) uninstalling until you get your act together and fix this.,
Matthew Nichols,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,21-Oct-20,18,"I get to the getting started screen and my phone freezes and then says app isn't responding. I've tried on WiFi, ice tried with WiFi off. Same result each time.",
Joseph Merlino,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,6-Dec-20,3,Totally useless. We had people saying they had it just to set off red flags. This is based on the honor system and that hasn't been something people done in a very long time.,
Cristino Aquino,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,14-Oct-20,19,"Numbers are not being updated ""Current COVID hospitalization"" has remained unchanged for weeks (459) I will uninstall app and consider reinstalling if issue is fixed.",
Monique Evans,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,7-Oct-20,3,"After initial set-up, there is an ""error 1002"" code. The app has that one bug.","State of New Jersey  ApplicationsOctober 7, 2020Hi Monique, Please try turning off the Wi-Fi during setup. Feel free to turn Wi-Fi back on after setting it up.

Sandy Mele,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,15-Nov-20,7,Having Bluetooth on always is not realistic plus it never alerted once. Dont waste the space on your phone for this app. Very disappointing,

Joanne,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,14-Nov-20,8,"The stupidest app ever. It is relying on the people who use it to be honest and informed. Right! Come on, how likely is that? Verification pin? Your still relying on people to admit they might be sick, get tested and then be honest enough to share that info. Good luck with that. Also. The people who are at the most risk are the ones who are the least likely to know how or want to use a cell phone app","State of New Jersey  ApplicationsOctober 8, 2020Hi Joanne, Uploading a positive requires a verification pin provided by the Department of Health after a positive COVID test. No need to rely on honesty. Thank you for your comment."
Eric Lugay,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,10-Oct-20,13,"This application shouldn't just depend on Bluetooth to operate, it should use a Wi-Fi signal. I hate turning on my Bluetooth, don't think it's safe for my health.",

You come within 6 Feet for more than 10 minutes of an infected person AND #3 The infected person AGREES to allow the Tracers to access the app code information. What code? When your phone meets another phone ( see #1) a code is sent via bluetooth to both phones. The app remembers the code info. The tracer simply activates that code to send you an alert.
